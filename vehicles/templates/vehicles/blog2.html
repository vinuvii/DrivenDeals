        <h1>The Importance of Vehicle Inspections Before Buying a Used Car</h1>
        <p>
            Buying a used car can be a great way to save money, but it's important to ensure that the vehicle is in good condition before making a purchase. Here are some reasons why a thorough vehicle inspection is crucial:
        </p>
        <div class="service">
            <h2>Uncover Hidden Issues</h2>
            <p>A detailed inspection can reveal hidden problems that may not be immediately apparent during a test drive. This can include issues with the engine, transmission, or other critical components.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="service">
            <h2>Ensure Safety</h2>
            <p>An inspection can identify safety concerns such as worn brakes, tires, or suspension components. Addressing these issues before buying can prevent accidents and costly repairs.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="service">
            <h2>Verify the Vehicle's History</h2>
            <p>A professional inspection can verify the accuracy of the vehicle's history report, ensuring there are no discrepancies related to accidents, repairs, or mileage.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="service">
            <h2>Negotiate a Better Price</h2>
            <p>If the inspection uncovers issues, you can use this information to negotiate a lower price with the seller. This can save you money and give you leverage during the buying process.</p>
